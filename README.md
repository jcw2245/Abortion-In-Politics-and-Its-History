For this project, I started with a dataset that showed me the rates between 2000 - 2022. I created a graphic that showed the numbers of abortions reported between 2000 - 2014, which was where it was last declining before it stayed steady with a little above 600,000.

I changed the second graphic that I had to a map that shows the number of abortions that the states reported to the CDC. This included annotations that were important to the data. This was a change from the first graphic that I started with, which was another bar chart. 

I wanted to do a story over this because of the political climate that we are in after the new Inauguration as this topic was picking up popularity. I wanted to take a unique approach of bringing up the political aspect of history. This includes how it became to be a topic of discussion in the political realm and the popularity in conversation because of Roe v. Wade and certain political parties.

This project has a little more work to be done, which would include interviews with professionals and possibly a personal story as well as updates on what has happened recently, if something new happens.
